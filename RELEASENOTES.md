grok.install is a cousin of grokproject.  grok.install just does a very simple installation.  To change passwords, domain names, and ip addresses you have to edit finfiles.  grokproject asks lots of questions simplifying the process for the end user, but making maintenance much harder. 

Really grok.install is a precursur to grokproject.  grok.install is a huge step towards upgrading grokproject. If anyone wants to I invite them to now upgrade grokproject.

I can't say that grok.install is perfect.  But it installs  for me, and I know of no known problems.  Moreover if you have a problem, other than on windows, I am happy to fix it quickly. 

Two things I would like to do.  Configure fanstatic, so that it server grokwiki/iki.css
and allow the gui to add an app. 

grok.intall egg
===============
I do not see a reason to turn grok.install into an egg, but if someone wants one, let me know and I am happy to do it. 



Notes on Grok
===============
grok.install is good, but now I want to fix other parts of grok.  
I need to write to the people with pull authority if they will accept my 
pull requests. 

We should remove grokwiki from grok.  It belongs in grok.install.

grokgui lost its nice grok icon.  

package grok should no longer refer to grokproject
